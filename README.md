# Tatiana Hernandez - Data Analysis Portfolio 

## About

As a seasoned Marketing Analytics professional with over a decade of experience, I specialize in leveraging data to drive strategic decision-making and transformational insights. My career has been dedicated to building and leading high-performing analytics teams, fostering a culture of data-driven decision-making within shared services environments. Bilingual in English and Spanish, I bring a global perspective to data analytics, having worked with diverse teams across multiple continents.

Currently serving as a Principal Analytics Engineer at Kaiser Permanente, I spearhead the development and support of IT analytics applications that optimize medical group operations and financial planning. My work in developing marketing analytics dashboards using Tableau has significantly improved patient retention rates by providing actionable insights into patient engagement and outreach.

Previously, I managed a team of data professionals at 3M, where I revolutionized pricing analytics for the Customer Operations Organization. By implementing advanced customer segmentation models with Adobe Analytics, I enhanced campaign targeting, resulting in a 20% increase in customer engagement and improved ROI.

My tenure as the Lead of Data Analytics at BAT saw me directing finance insights analytics across America and Africa. Here, I successfully implemented marketing attribution models that optimized budget allocation and improved marketing efficiency, leading to a 20% reduction in customer acquisition costs.

At Amazon, as a senior advertisement business intelligence developer, I led a team that analyzed business advertising data, which drove key revenue strategies. My efforts in A/B testing and campaign analysis using Google Optimize contributed to a 15% increase in advertising ROI.

Throughout my career, I have consistently demonstrated my ability to integrate advanced analytics into business processes, delivering measurable improvements in marketing effectiveness and customer engagement. My expertise spans a wide range of analytical tools and methodologies, including media mix modeling, marketing measurement, and the implementation of cutting-edge marketing technologies.
